                <h4>Our Anti-Harassment Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This code of conduct applies to all <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b> spaces, including the cabal, repositories, and at local events,
                    both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct (including organizers) may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
                </p>

                <h4>Consequences</h4>
                <p>
                    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a participant engages in continued harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
                    including expulsion from all <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b> spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b>
                    participants or the general public.
                </p>

                <b> Harassment includes </b>
                <ul>
                    <li> Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
                        disability, mental</li>

                    <li> Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those
                        related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>

                    <li> Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
                    <li> <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b> prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Organizers reserve the right
                        not to act on complaints regarding:

                            <li> Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with
                                you”</li>
                            <li> Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
                            <li> Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

                <h4>Reporting</h4>
                <p>
                    If you are being harassed at a <b>peer to peer ÖRESUND</b> event, notice that someone else is being
                    harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers and we will handle this as
                    discretely as possible. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse
                    themselves from handling your incident.
                </p>
